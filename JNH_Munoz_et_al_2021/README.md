Manuscript to be submitted to Wilson Journal of Ornithology

For this manuscript I included data on 8 nest found in Manu National Park, Peru. 

Important notes:

**Nest attentiveness**

The calculations for nest attentiveness were performed in two independent ways: 
1. Using incR, since the algoritm not always works perfectly I use data visualization to confirm a good fit and then that the data was accurate, some days such us the first and last of the period were removed given thaht the package did not fit well the data so it could not distingish in and off bout propoertly.

The calculation for the K (Growth rate) were performed using a RCode by Juanpa Gomez, that fit the threee different logistic regressions proposed by Ricklefs 1968, and uses an IAC approach to select the best fitted model.

2)Simultaneously nest attentivenes was calculated with data extracted from camera traps by Margarita Cantero, the result of the calculation is very similar for the nest P02_AJRC13 which have the full nesting period using both methods difference 52.5 vs 56%  

If I only use the data from camera trap I will be able to incorporate data from  P02_IGZ14 taht has 4 days of data, but the problem with that nest is that P02_IGZ14 [need to excluded August 29 cause is incomplete, and sept2 (hatching day) included August 30-Sept 01], the days that shoudl be included are at the end oftheincubation period which might inflate the mean.

Nest attentiveness was finally just presented for one nest, because the other two nest only have data for the end of the incubation period what will potentially inflate the mean, I could included in the graph but I am not so sure about it.

#####
The final file is "Nest_attentiveness_by_method.csv"".  I used the data from the sensors from Sep 13 to Sept 26, and added the missing data from camera traps Sep 9-12, and also data from sep 27 adn 28th. That way I included data for most days taht I have data from. The data with both methods was similar, so I decided to combine them to have all days covered.

List of nest for the species

Eggs:Total shouild be 17 eggs  P4_GVC10*,P24_JAEc_10*,P03_JMGP12*,P56_MASM_12*,P02_AJRC13*,P100_MASM13*,P31_MASM13*,P02_IGZ14* 

Nestlings: P2JMM11, P02_IGZ14,P40_JSH14 

Predated

P4_GVC10/75 same nest some code error [ Abandoned_2 eggs] /notebook 2/pag 75 
P24_JAEc_10 [Predated _2 eggs]
P2JMM11 [2 nestlings sucessful]camera trap, should have complete nestling period, data not          found]
P03_JMGP12 (predated toucan_2eggs)Camera trap data,nootbook 11/pag 126 
P56_MASM_12[Abandoned_2eggs]
P02_AJRC13 [Predated_ 3eggs, camera trap  21 days incubation period)

P100_MASM13 [Predated _2 eggs]snake (data from camera traps not found, why?)
P31_MASM13 [Predated _2 eggs] Camera tr (2 days of data, predated saguinus ruficollis) 


P02_IGZ14  nootbook 23/pag25 [ eggs and nestlings,  sucessful (4 days of incubation                     and full nesting period) Camera trap data
P40_JSH14 ???? nootbook 23/pag55 [1 nestling, predated?] (I dont have anydata on this one but is in one of the databases )




*Analyses of camara-traps, mostly for biparental analyses*
A total of 5+2 (But data was not analysed because data wasn't found in the harddrive for P2JMM11 P100MASM13) independent nest were monitored  with camera traps. The nest with camera traps and data status were:
P02_IGZ14 (4 days of incubation and full nesting period)
P02_AJRC13 (21 days incubation period, -4 days of nestlings)
P03_JMGP12 (predated toucan)
P04_GVC10 (no data)
P31_MASM13 (only 2 days of data, predated saguinus ruficollis) 
P2JMM11 (data not analysed, why? should have all nestling period with feeding events)
P100MASM13 (data from camera traps not found, why?)

I then extracted the data for 3 nest and included data on days that have the full day monitored (i.e 00:00-23:59)
P02_AJRC13[excluded Sept 8incomplete, sept 23 y 24 (no batteries until 24 8:00 am)  sep 28 (hatching day?), included Sept 9-Sept 26]
P02_IGZ14 [excluded August 29, and sept2 (hatching day) included August 30-Sept 01]
P31_MASM13


**note**In any related calculation based on camara traps for nest P02_AJRC13, including incubation, foraging trips I excluded the data from 23 and 24 sept 

In any calculation for brooding I excluded SEPT 2 because it is not clear time of hatching

The K (growing rate was calculated for two nestlings independently) and averaged for the two as follows
sum(0.451+0.465)/2
