#3.RSTB_Neotropical mixed-species bird flocks in a community context_Munoz & Jamkowski 2022
Data and R scripts for the manuscript. In this study our goal is to use  comparisons of the traits of flocking species,  non-flocking species and the larger bird community, and the traits of flocking species occupying different habitats and elevations, to gain insight into the ecological and evolutionary constraints on mixed-species flock participation, as well as the role of these community modules in structuring bird communities.
